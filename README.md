## Course Projects 

### April-2025 
## Course - Neural Networks Deep Learning, NLP, Transformers , Prompt Engineering 
### Project - Recommendation engine .
 Built a recommendation engine for buying home and kitchen projects on amazon. Amazon has millions of data about their products and customer reviews. We used pre-trained transformer based models from huggingface and fine tuned them with custom dataset ( in this case amazon customer review question answer dataset) to enhance Question Answering Task.  
 #### Key highlights of the project 
1.  Transformer Neural Network: The foundational architecture used for natural language processing tasks.
2. Chatbot Assistant (Built with Streamlit): A user-friendly interface that allows interactive conversations and product recommendations.
3.  DistilBERT – Question and Answering Model: A lightweight transformer model used to extract relevant information from a subset of Amazon review data.
4.  Sentence-Transformer LML6 – Semantic Similarity Model: We used this model to computes sentence embeddings to identify and match semantically similar Amazon reviews for enhanced recommendation accuracy.
5. Large Language Model (LLM) – Mistral with Prompt Engineering: Used this model for NLP tasks .  This model is already trained on a huge dataset and billions of parameters. We used this model as is to processes raw Amazon review data using tailored prompts to generate accurate and context-aware responses.
#### Tools and Skills covered  
* Hugging Face models ( Sentence-Transformer LML6, Large Language Model (LLM) – Mistral ,DistilBERT) 
* Streamlit 
* Prompt Engineering
* RAG (Retreival Augmented Generation)
* Vector store (FAISS)
* Pytorch Framework


### Feb-2025 
## Course -Supervised learning, Unsupervised learning, Regression , Classification, ML Optimization 
### Project - Lung cancer early detection .
Analyzed the data and came up with a predictive model to determine if a person is susceptible  to lung cancer based on demographic , lifestyle factors to a certain degree. 
#### Tools used and skills covered 
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Data Preprocessing
* Traditional machine learning models (Decision Tree Classifer , Random Forest Classifier ,logistic regression)
* K-Means clustering
* Hyperparameter Tuning
* Cross Validation 
* Performance Metrics 


### Dec-2024 
## Course - Python Programming, Pandas Data Preparation, Data Visualizations, Data predictions  
### Project - Money Miners 
Perform an exploratory data analysis on the price trends for Bitcoin, Gold, and the S&P 500 and use historical data to forecast future trends for the three commodities to provide actionable insights for an investor trying to figure out the best commodity to invest in.  
#### Tools used and skills covered 
* Python programming
* Pandas
* Google prophet model 

### Oct-2024
## Course AI Fundamentals 
### Project - AI -Case Study. 
As part of this case study we had to pick an AI company and conduct a research on how the company evolved and used emerging AI technologies to improve its business processes . The company I researched is on AI in Radiology - Fujifilm HealthCare
